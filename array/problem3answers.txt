a. For sorting numbers, arrays would be the best data structure because they can be looped through and compared in consecutive positions
and data is not being deleted or created.

b. For scheduling jobs to a CPU, a queue would be the best data structure because it's a first in first out process that allows the first processes
inserted to be executed first.

c. Stack because the index is eventually returned to zero after the recursive function completes, but the data is still accessible.

d. Tree because it allows hierarchical order. (Folders can have sub folders)

e. Graphs because all users that are connected can see and interact with each other.
