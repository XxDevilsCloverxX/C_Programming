The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themâ€”all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themâ€”â€œI wish theyâ€™d
get the trial done,â€ she thought, â€œand hand round the refreshments!â€
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.
