On his first continental tour begun in 1809 Byron visited Portugal
Spain Albania Greece and Turkey. Of this tour he composed a poetical
journal Childe Harold's Pilgrimage in which he ascribed his
experiences and reflections not to himself but to a fictitious
character Childe Harold described as a melancholy young nobleman
prematurely familiar with evil sated with pleasures and embittered
against humanity. The substantial merits of the work however lay not
in this shadowy and somewhat theatrical figure but in Byron's spirited
descriptions of wild or picturesque scenes and in his eloquent
championing of Spain and Greece against their oppressors. On his
return to England in 1811 he was persuaded rather against his own
judgment into allowing the work to be published. Its success was
almost unprecedented in his own words he awoke and found himself
famous.
